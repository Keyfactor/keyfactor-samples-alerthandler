# Keyfactor Alert Handler Samples

The Keyfactor platform performs various actions upon certificate life cycle events such as issuance,
upcoming expiration, workflow approval, and workflow denial.

PowerShell scripts may be used to implement custom actions for these events.
This repository contains sample alert handler implementations.

Samples in this repository are intended to show what sort of interactions between Keyfactor and external systems are possible.
Samples in this repository are NOT intended for production use without modification.
These samples may contain hard coded credentials or other things that may not be appropriate for your production environment.

See the Keyfactor documentation for details on how configure alert handlers.
